Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course from Johns hopkins Univercity. 

The file, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1.If it does not already exist in the working directory, Download the dataset.

2.Load not only the activity and feature information but also both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns 
  which reflect a mean or standard deviation.

3.Don't forget to Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset after that, 
  merges the two datasets.

4.Converts the activity and subject columns into factors.

5.Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
